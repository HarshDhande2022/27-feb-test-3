                    <h4>Communication is the heart of every organisation.

                    <li><h2>Bloging</h2></li>
                    <h4>Blogging, just as any kind of writing, proves you have communication and writing skills. 
                        Data shows communication is the most important skill for people entering the workforce.</h4>
                    <li><h2>Learning Languages</h2></li>
                    <h4>Speaking English might not be enough if you’re planning on developing your career. The three fastest-emerging languages of global consumers are Russian, Hindi, and Japanese. 
                        Studies have found a correlation between learning languages and problem-solving abilities, intelligence, and memory skills.</h4>

                    <li><h2>Travel</h2></li>
                    <h4>Curiosity, courage, and self-organization. Traveling can prove you’re not afraid of stepping outside your comfort zone and learning new things.
                         And flexibility and adaptability are among the most important workplace personal traits.</h4>
                    <li><h2>Sports</h2></li>
                    <h4>It doesn’t matter what sport you do. Exercising in general develops self-discipline, patience, and helps bounce back from disappointment.
                         Team sports create opportunities to improve leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills, too.</h4>
